# 2D Grid-Based Game Engine

Welcome to the 2D Grid-Based Game Engine repository! This engine is developed as the final assignment for the Programming 4 course. 

## Introduction

This game engine provides a foundation for creating 2D grid-based games seen in the course Programming 4 in my second year at the DAE.

## Features

- **Game Loop**
- **Game Objects**
- **Components**
- **Inputs + Commands**
- **Observers**
- **Sound with threading**

## Examples + Controlls

I will make the retro game Q-bert with this engine!

In Q-bert, you can use WASD to move and press space to select something.
Or you can use the d-pad from a controller and press 'A' to select things!
Enjoy!

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have any ideas for improvements or new features, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Acknowledgments

Special thanks to my Programming 4 Course Instructors for their guidance and support throughout the development of this project.
