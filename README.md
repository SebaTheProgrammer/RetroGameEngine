# 2D Grid-Based Game Engine

Welcome to the 2D Grid-Based Game Engine repository! This engine is developed as the final assignment for the Programming 4 course. 

## Introduction

This game engine provides a foundation for creating 2D grid-based games. It includes essential features such as grid management, entity management, collision detection, and basic rendering capabilities.

## Features

- **Grid Management**: Easily create and manage 2D grids of any size.
- **Entity Management**: Efficiently handle game entities within the grid.
- **Basic Rendering**: Render the game world with basic graphics.
- **Customization**: Easily extend and customize functionality to suit specific game requirements.

## Getting Started

To get started with using the game engine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Explore the codebase to understand the structure and functionality.
3. Use the provided examples and documentation to start building your own game.

## Examples

Check out the `examples` directory for sample projects demonstrating the usage of the game engine.

I will make the retro game Q-bert with this engine!

## Documentation

For detailed documentation on how to use the game engine, refer to the `docs` directory.

## Contributing
